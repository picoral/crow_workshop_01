  Great price for order decent pencils although I'm a pencil snob. I purchased these for my children's classrooms, and the students will likely use them up quickly, bite the end off in day one, and never notice any small flaws.The erasers are a bit wobbly compared to my favorite brand pencil. This may cause the eraser to break off with young students vigorous erasing. They also don't sharpen quite as smoothly in the electric sharpener. My picture shows the Amazon pencil on the right with more of a rough cut wood. The Ticonderoga is the left pencil which sharpens easier. Lastly, I had to press the pencil slightly harder in paper than my favorite pencil to get the same look. However, these Amazon pencils are way better than most other store pencils and better than all dollar store pencils.

  As a teacher I need pencils to last, the first pencil I sharpened went down to less than half. It’s less than half and still it’s not sharp—it broke again.

  I got these pre-sharpened pencils for convenience, because 50% of my kids don’t bring pencils, and waiting for them all to sharpen new pencils is excruciating. The pencils are great for that. However, when they get dull and I attempt to sharpen them (in a hand-crank sharpener—my electric one broke earlier this year) they do that infuriating thing where the lead breaks/falls out and the wooden part sharpens at an angle, over and over. Super frustrating.

  I was so excited to buy these for my classroom, but I would never do it again.  They will not sharpen in the wall mounted hand cranked sharpener, which is what the students typically use. It just chews them up. Even when I use my heavy duty electric sharpener there are problems, mostly because you often get sharp wood but no lead because it is off-centered. I am so disappointed. I was trying to make my life easier, but these definitely didn’t help!

  These are not great.  The lead breaks constantly.  I always check the lead before giving it to a student--it would break.  I'd sharpen again.  Another broken lead... I'd finally get the lead to not break when I tested it, but the student would be back again minutes later with broken lead.  Now I have 150 pencils that are not useful for the classroom.  So frustrating!

  These pencils are hard to sharpen, they break easy, and they will sharpen un-even. Quality is below average! The price is too much for the quality of these pencils. I definitely don't recommend these to no one. A total waste of money, save your cash and buy another brand!

  These are the worst pencils I have ever seen! My kids have been complaining about them for a while, but I thought they just wanted something 'fancy' until I tried them myself.You can't sharpen these pencils. The lead is in mini pieces inside the wood casing so every time you sharpen a little, a piece of lead falls out so you have to sharpen some more. And then you just keep sharpening until there's no pencil left. I got wiser and just throw them out once the initial point gets worn down.Also, the erasers are worthless! Well, yeah, they erase, but only if they stay ON THE PENCIL!! Unfortunately, they're so flimsy that they break off when you try to erase!!

  These pencils are just ok. They are rather light weight, which isn't horrible,  but it makes them feel like a lower quality.The paint of many of them is cracked. I know that is kind of a little thing, but again, it makes them feel low quality.They look a little dirty. I'm not sure if it's because they are pre-sharpened, and it's pencil lead that was loose from shipping, or if it's from the machine they are sharpened with.Ok, that was the negatives, on to the positives. The price point is good. You get more pencils for less than you will pay for other brands such as Ticonderoga or Dixon. Our schools always need pencils, so these will go to add to their resource room where I'm sure they will be used.

  I'm very impressed with these pencils. Being a Math teacher we go through a lot of pencils. On a side note I'm a true pencil snob.... love my Ticonderoga pencils keeping those pencils for testing only. Definitely buying more Amazon pencils and the eraser is not bad at all. It erased completely didn't leave that annoying smudge.

  Read some reviews about these pencils and learned there are some finicky people out there about a simple product.  These are a box of #2 pencils that come pre-sharpened and do everything you'd expect a pencil to do.  You know...like write, erase, get waggled back and forth between your thumb & forefinger, have that ""rubber pencil"" trick thing done to them that every kid does.  I haven't found ANY of the problems mentioned in other reviews.  They re-sharpen great, last a while, taste decent when you bite into them as you're deep in thought and are a CRAZY good deal at this price.  Looking for a box of straight ahead, solid, user friendly pencils at a GREAT price?  Add these to your cart, move on and don't worry about reviews by picky pencil people.

  Finally got around to opening this box of pencils and they are honestly one of the worst pencils ever. They look great and write well but as soon as the tip breaks, they don’t sharpen great. And I’ve tried several different sharpeners so I know it’s the pencil. It’s really a shame because o have a whole box of unused pencils that really only have use until the tip breaks

  These pencils SUCK!!!!!! I'm writing a story and need a good, sharp, even pencil.  By The time I get a sharp, viable point on both sides, the pencil is down to a nub. You can only write about one sentence (and it better be short) before you have to sharpen it again. I would suggest you spend a little extra and buy the good brand. Don't buy these! I'd send them back if I could!  I also have a very good sharpener so that's not the problem.

  I bought these because I wanted to make sure that my high school math students never had the excuse that they did not have a pencil. I wanted the pre-sharpened, so I could easily pull one out and not get an excuse that it wasn't sharpened.I keep some in a basket that is in the back of my classroom. I keep the reserve in my filing cabinet. There have been many times where I am teaching, notice a kid not writing, seamlessly go to my cabinet, grab a pencil and give it to the student.I will be ordering more, so my stock will never run out. It is just sad that I have to buy these myself because (a) the kids don't have them and (b) I can't get them from my school. :(

   I bought these for my kids ages 7 yrs, 4 yrs, 2 yrs, and 1yr.As other reviews said, there is a gap in the eraser ring, but I wiggled it around and pulled a bit on it and everything stayed in place. The kids have been using them today (they erase a lot) and we haven't had any problems. Erasers work great.They are durable even against the being banged on the table and excitedly smashed against paper to draw/write.I sharpened a few with my electric sharpener and it worked well, no breaking lead or other problems.

  I’m a high school English teacher. If there is one constant in the universe, it’s that teens never come to class prepared. I tend to supply a lot of pencils so students will actually do their work, but I run through them quickly. I’ve bought a lot of inexpensive pencils and many don’t sharpen very well in the basic Boston sharpener that schools use. These seem to sharpen as well as most quality pencils... so none have been ground down by an overzealous kid and thrown in the trash.

  These are great for my grade school kids. They are presharpened saving me tons of time come early September when we're fill pencil boxes for back to school. I don't even think a single pencil tip was broken upon arrival. The erasers work decent though I tend to give my kids pencil caps to use anyway. This box of 150 should last me 2 or 3 school years if not more. I purchased a second box to donate to one of my children's teachers and they were extremely appreciative.

  I don't know what type of pencil sharpener they are using but these can hardly be called pre-sharpened.  The points are flat and have like 1/32"" tip that goes away after first use.  I'll end up having to buy a sharpener and resharpen these.  Otherwise they seem like any other pencil.

  I am always, so far, happy with any Amazon Basics purchases I have made. This is no exception to that.I gave two of my children dozens of these when school started, and probably will still have a lot of them when school starts again next August. The beauty of these is that they are already sharpened, and they store in their box perfectly.

  Good pencils- all of them came sharpened with a nice point. Perfect gift for teachers or for parents with school-aged children. Saves a bit of time and sanity since these are pre-sharpened!Update: Just wanted to add that these pencils lasted a long time. They don’t break easily and the erasers don’t get hard/unusable even after being placed in storage for a while.

  These pencils will not sharpen properly.  Most of the time the lead breaks off. I have tried two different pencil sharpeners and it's the same with both of them.  My recommendation is to spend a bit more and get pencils that are functional.

  Got these for the kids I teach to use during testing.  For the $ It was a good value for the quantity you get.  They were light weight and average in thickness. It comes already Sharpened which was good.  It didn’t feel that sturdy or solid to me. Some of the pencils I used already or the students used did the job but some students they tend to push down on theirs to hard and end up braking the tip.  Resharpening the pencils was just ok also.  It didn’t feel solid and some of the lead actually was looser and you could remove it which wasn’t good !  The eraser worked pretty good I can say.  It’s a hit and miss with these.  Good thing was you get a lot of pencils to go thru and hopefully they are not all the same.  So you’ll find good ones in the pack eventually on a good note !

  Purchased these for my classroom thinking I was getting a wonderful deal, especially since they are already sharpened. We've had nothing but problems since. Every pencil I've sharpened breaks almost immediately. It's like the lead is broken inside the pencils or something. In a week, we've probably gone through 60 pencils, sharpened down to a nub. I'll stick with Ticonderoga!

  These sticks are awesome! I bought them for my boys to use as daggers since they are already sharpened. As one of them went to slash the wall, it left a gray streak as if to say, ""Ace was here"" Later we realized that the sharp end would also leave the same grey streak on all types of cardboard, wood, paper and canvas. Awesome product, I know, but I am about to blow your mind. While my kids were using the pink end made for rub burns they found out that if you rub it against the gray streaks, they magically DISAPPEAR! I know this is crazy! It's like a box of 150 little stabbing time machines! I can't wait to buy more when my homeschoolers run out of these.

  I bought these as they seemed to be a great deal. They came pre-sharpened, which seemed great at the start. The pre-sharpened ends, are dull bulbs and when you try to sharpen the pencil, the graphite breaks almost every time! It's so delicate that if you're lucky enough to get the pencil sharpened without breaking, you are left with a 3 inch pencil, on the FIRST SHARPENING! I would NOT recommend these pencils unless you are buying them for someone you hate!

  Been buying these boxes of pencils for the past year or so. We are now on our third box (yeah, that's what happens when our teen boys fail to put their pencils back in their backpack or pencil bag in their binder! Really, it's not hard, but they have yet to reach this developmental milestone). Thus, I love buying Amazon's bulk pencils.So glad these now come pre-sharpened! That little meaningful improvement cuts 30 seconds of pencil sharpening stress as we are trying to run out the door in the morning and someone realizes they don't have any pencils on hand. I put a bunch of these pre-sharpened beauties in a large clear mason jar, near where they store their backpacks. No excuses for being without a writing utensil!Back to my point... these are high quality pencils and an excellent value. Way to go, Amazon, for keeping our whole family stocked with quality school supplies like these pencils.

  of all the things to cut corners on, you cut corners on your pencils?? these pencils are terrible. they are nearly impossible to sharpen, the tip breaks off over and over and over. after the initial pre sharpened point is gone they are basically worthless. what a waste of material. this is why our planet is in the gutter, because garbage companies make garbage products just to scam us out of our hard earned money and where do these products go? the trash. landfills. DO NOT BUY THESE PENCILS!! splurge on ticonderoga or another pencil brand that will actually sharpen.

  I thought it'd be an excellent idea to get these for a teacher friend.  She always says that students lose pencils and are always asking if she has one.  So For a cheap price you can get 150 #2s.  For starters, the erasers on these are very cheap.  Some will even fall off after a couple uses.  The pencils sharpen easily - which is a bonus, but then it eats up most of the pencil in the sharpening process.  Not a fan.  I'd rather spend a bit more to get a better quality pencil.

  these pencils are good quality and the erasers aren't that bad. I like that they are presharpened so I was able to use them right out of the box. I haven't had to resharpen of them as of yet. Got these mainly to replace pencils in my drawing kit that were too small or didn't want to sharpen any more. Thank you amazon for an awesome product and keep up the food work.Also as a side note the way they shipped they put a little piece of Styrofoam stuff to keep the tips from breaking thought that was a cool addition to safety of the product while it ships.

  The price seemed like a bargain. I'm using these to include in pencil pouches with school supplies for Operation Christmas Child. You can see examples of school supplies and pencil pouches at blessingsinashoebox.com. I always include pencil sharpeners but I like that the pencils are pre-sharpened because the receiving children can use them right away and it make resharpening easier. They seem consistent and as wooden pencils they are fine. I would have given a higher rating but I only received 130 pencils not 150 as stated. I'm going to keep them and use them because I think the quality is decent and for 20 pencils it isn't worth the hassle of returning them for a replacement but I'll probably go back to buying the other brand before. The price is still good for 130 pencils and more importantly including them in OCC shoeboxes will offer children opportunities that they would otherwise not have. .

  I purchased these to donate to our church ""Back to School Backpack"" drive.  They're pre-sharpened and just what you expect from an ordinary pencil, with a few drawbacks.LENGTH:  The length of each pencil was consistent.ERASERS: The erasers aren't the best and are a bit ""wobbly"".  As well, they don't erase cleanly.  They leave a pink residue behind.  I don't like that.LEAD/SHARPENING: If you sharpen, sometimes the lead falls out.  Also, some of the pencils just keep sharpening down lower and lower.  You start with a new pencil and end up with half the pencil on one sharpening.  This doesn't happen with all the pencils, but it happens enough to be frustrating.VALUE:  The price is great.  However, I won't be buying again.  They just don't last long enough.

  I have bought both the sharpened and unsharpened Amazon pencils.  They are both great, standard #2 pencils.  The price does fluctuate a with the sharpened ones a bit.  I looked at them before and first bought the unsharpened ones since they were a fair bit less.  When I bought the 150 sharpened ones at the beginning of the month, they were 9.99 dollars, but I've seen the price go up and down, currently 12.49 dollars.

  These are okay for the price, but definitely not great. In some of the pencils the lead is off center.Edit: Originally, I gave these 4 stars with the orginal review above. However, the more we use them the more I hate them. So often the lead is off center, which causes the lead to break easily. The kids are constantly having to stop their assignments and get up to sharpen their penicils. It is so distracting.  We still have a lot of these left, but they will be going in the trash and I will happily pay more for quality pencils.

If they take care of them and turn in all 8 the following week to be sharpened they recieve a small reward plus 8 newly sharpened pencils. These pencils were a great start but when I went to sharpen them the lead continously broke while sharpening. After more than half of them doing this I got frustrated and threw the rest away instead of sharpening them. I will never buy these again!

  I am a high school teacher, so I like to have pencils on hand to loan out to students.  These pre-sharpened pencils make it easy to hand to a student for them to get right to work.  They sharpen decently in my electric sharpener.  For the price, I was not expecting perfect high quality pencils.  I wanted a basic pencil with a functional eraser and that is exactly what I got.

  Not really sure what ""sheerness"" indicates on a rating scale for a pencil, but sheerness is the problem.  These are nice enough pencils, good erasers, take a sharp point.  The problem is that the lead doesn't write dark enough.  I've compared these to other pencils that I own and there is a distinct difference. The writing is so light-colored that it becomes difficult to read especially when using yellow legal pads and white isn't much better. Do not recommend, find another vendor.

  Are you too lazy to sharpen your pencil from start, these come pre-sharpened so they are ready out of the bag/box. Cheap easy to use, the erasers are ok, I would recommend buying a separate stand-alone eraser so that your don't ruin your paper.

  This product sounded like a great idea.  However, the quality of the pencils are so poor.  My high school students complain about how easily the pencils literally break in half and how the lead keeps breaking when you try to sharpen the pencil.  I will not buy this again.  Didn't even use half the box before I just caved and went to Staples to buy Ticonderoga pencils.

  If you are looking for good wooden pencils don't buy these.  The lead in many of the pencils is not straight and in the middle thus they sharpen poorly leaving wood over halfway up the point.

  These are pencils, not really much to say. The lead/graphite does not break easily after sharpening, eraser ends do not fall off,  The paint coating, ow whatever it is, is thick and there are no splinters. The wood material is not that plastic wood type, but appears to be a real wood, or at least the texture of a real wood. No complaints here.

  As a teacher,  I need presharpened pencils. I can't have ten kids in line trying to sharpen pencils and avoid work.  The Amazon basics are ok, but the points could be better. They don't resharpen too easily. Why can't Amazon offer better prices for teachers who have $0 budget and use their own money?

  My kids are all in elementary school. I used to purchase Ticonderoga #2 pencils for them. But they always go through the pencils like eating them, so I want to try some other brand which is cheaper and durable. I choose Amazon one, which is not disappointed me. They have good writing ability and are sharpen well. They sharpen quite as smoothly as in the electric sharpener. The only concern is eraser. Some erasers loose and break easily, which make it not erase completely. My kids used the eraser on different types of paper and it did not erase well. I hope this review can help others to find a good product.

  These pre-sharpened pencils were gifts for my children's teachers as well as a box for my own classroom. They are not quite as good as those expensive ones, but they are presharpened and fairly durable. The only real complaint is that they tend not to sharpen straight, so you get a weird sharp point on only half of one side occasionally.

  The pencils break easily and are very cheaply made. You may as well buy pencils from the Dollar Tree, they work just as good. They came barely sharpened as well so it wasn't worth paying extra to get the pre-sharpened box. I had many lose erasers while being used too in my class. I usually love Amazon Basic products but was very unhappy with this order. I'll stick to my big boxes of unsharpened Ticonderoga pencils from Costco. Signed, a disappointed teacher.

  My granddaughter’s first grade teacher asked each student to bring 48 pencils as student supplies. Evidentially now students are being asked to make up for their classmates poverty as excessive amounts of crayons were also on the list.  I just donated the whole box.

  They seem to be a bit on the light side but overall they are very decent pencils, with a good electronic sharpener they keep the led 90% of the time unlike lower quality pencils that have the led fall out half of the time you sharpen them. Overall they are a good value and get the job done.

  The pencils are pre-sharpened and are fine so long as their original points last. However, when I put them in my electric pencil sharpener, the sound is very different from what I'm used to, in a way that makes me wonder whether they're damaging the machine. I haven't actually seen any damage, but I don't want to risk it; I've decided that these pencils will be thrown out instead of being sharpened.

  I purchased  these pencils a few times for my children.  The pencil is high quality for the price and also has No 2 lead.

  These are regular old #2 pencils. I prefer the wood in Dixon-Ticonderoga AND many leads seem to be broken inside the pencils. I'm wondering if the box was dropped during shipping.

They sharpen well enough and the wood is no where near as poorly made as dollar store brands that my students brought in at the beginning of year.

  I needed a lot of pencils in my shop for woodworking projects.  It always seems that when I need a pencil, I can't find one.  So I'm done screwing around.  Found this giant box of pre-sharpened pencils, and have disbursed them throughout the shop.  I'm looking forward to NOT looking for pencils anymore.

  These elegantly crafted, extremely durable, wooden writing tools, will. Rock. Your. World. Before ordering these pencils I too was like you, writing in poverty, frequent hand cramps, smudged writing, sharpening my own pencils like a neanderthal. But no more! With this 150 pack of AmazonBasics Pre-sharpened Wood Cased #2 HB Pencils you will see educational growth you've never seen before. With the speed and sharpness given by these tools you will write faster, better, and more fluently.

  These pencils write just fine.  But good luck erasing!  The erasers are a mess!!!  They do nothing more than smear grey all around.

But these pencils just don't do it for me.

  These look OK when they arrive but the real problem is in sharpening them. I tried using three different electric pencil sharpeners but no matter which one I chose, the pencils would not sharpened correctly. The problem was that the lead does not run directly down the middle of the pencil so it always sharpened crooked and the lead broke off either inside the sharpener or immediately afterwards.

  Relative to other pencils, these are very good. So I will explain why I only gave it two stars:I purchased these because they came up as a ""try this similar Amazon item""- implying that it was comparable to Ticonderaga pencils. While they are fine pencils, they most certainly do not compare to Ticonderaga pencils which I need for a child with weaker stamina.

  One reason I ordered these is because they were pre-sharpened. Unfortunately they are sharpened like golf scorecard pencils. Not sharp or tapered as expected. I am resharpening these prior to use. Disappointing.Other than that these seem to be good quality and a great value.

  I ordered these for my students to use in class. They work fine until the pre-sharpened point wears down. When you have to sharpen them, as one does with pencils, the graphite breaks repeatedly. One will sharpen, and sharpen, and sharpen, until the pencil is sharpened down to a nub. Worthless.

  I keep pencils in a cup on my table for my students to use when I meet with them as a small group.  Because these pencils are pre-sharpened, I can see that the pencil graphite is straight inside the wood of the pencil.  If you've ever had one of those pencils that you could sharpen all day and never get to a usable point because there's always one side that's still wood, you know what I'm talking about.  These pencils don't seem to work that way.  I've got 2 more boxes in my cart to share with my department.

  I am an art teacher so decent and abundant pencils are kind of essential. The lead in these is constantly breaking so the pencils run out fast and time is wasted having to continuously sharpen them with fingers crossed that it won't break again. The little lead fragments are also super distracting to the little ones, or lost on the floor and end in an abstract work being created on the tiles by students slipping and sliding their chairs around - the janitors are less than impressed.. I'll be sure to spend the extra funds from now on to get some quality pencils, I'd recommend that you do the same.

  I didn’t pay a lot for the sharpening and it’s good because the pencils are sharpened poorly. They are not safe for students to use. They have to be sharpened again. Strangely enough there too sharp but not enough lead.

  These pencils are fine, but they do not sharpen correctly. Most of the time, once sharpened, the graphite just falls out. I wouldn't recommend these for classroom use. As an elementary school teacher, I have wasted a lot of time resharpening pencils until the graphite stays put.

  Unfortunately the quality could be better. I teach middle school and as soon as I get pencils I’m practically out (kids walk out with them).These are great for me because I just need a sharp #2 for 40 minutes. The lead in these is already broken. You shake the pencil and you can hear and feel the broken lead inside. Shame. The outside is pretty, but they are a monster to sharpen (lead constantly breaks).

  I don’t normally write reviews but being a broke teacher these things irritate me. I bought these pencils for my classroom. Thought it was a great deal. However most of the pencils we’ve had to throw away after only maybe sharpening one more time because they end up looking like this one. Very frustrating because we should be able to sharpen them many more times before having to throw away.

They arrived sharpened (although the level of sharpening to which they arrive might not be the appropriate level of sharpness to everyone) and un-chewed (unlike those times you borrowed a pencil from Rachel in your high school science class, a girl to which you held upon a pedestal, only to realize that she has the disgusting habit of chewing pencils down to their core).For the price and quantity, you couldn't beat the value.

  These are the pencils from your nightmare. You know the reoccurring dream where you have to use a #2 pencil for a standardized test, and every single pencil is a nightmare to sharpen. You can sharpen this down to nothing and never be able to write with it. Such a waste of money and resources!

  As a 4th grade teacher, pencils disappear faster than I can replace them. These are great for keeping my stock replenished, especially for the price. However, I have noticed that most of the erasers fall off very quickly with any sort of tough [read 10-year-old] handling. The whole metal part detaches from the wood and falls off or gets pulled off easily.

  I have had to throw away about half the box already. The lead inside most of the pencils is broken. Every time we sharpen one the lead just falls out rendering the pencils useless.

  The pencils are pre-sharpened which makes them easy to hand out and get started in class. Unfortunately about a quarter of the pencils do not resharpen easily. I have also had issues with the eraser falling out when students attempt to erase anything.

  Purchased these pencils for my business. They come pre-sharpened, but what they dont tell you is that they can never be sharpened again.  Ive used a regular hand held sharpener and an electric and nothing is working.  If they do sharpen, its uneven and dull and breaks after one use.  Dont waste your time or money!

  I am a third grade teacher and I bought these pencils to try to alleviate some of my pencil sharpening nightmares. Once these pencils get dull, they do not sharpen well in either my automatic pencil sharpener, nor my manual pencil sharpener. The lead never gets sharper, and the sides get uneven making the pencil useless.

  These pencils are used in an elementary classroom.  Because they are presharpened, students who need a pencil don't have to interrupt teaching by the noise of sharpening...a small thing, but every disruption takes away from instruction.

  Since I'm tinkering a lot more on my weekends, I come into situations where I need a simple pencil a lot more than I used to.This rectified said situations.  I certainly wouldn't use these for artistic drawing right out of the box, they aren't that well sharpened.  But again, I got these for the times I'm at my toolbox workstation and just need to grab a pencil to mark something or scrawl out a note and the pencils are adequately sharpened for that.About a quarter of these pencils are gone now.... Since other household members take one when they need a pencil.  I guess it's a good thing I bought this box instead of going to the store and buying a couple.  They would have disappeared by now!

  These are a gift from the gods for teachers.  They are already sharpened,  write well and sharpen again easily.  I have attached a photo of the box, the pencils as they arrive sharpened (top pencil, closer to box) and after sharpening in an electric sharpener (bottom pencil).I took them all out, spray painted a line of lime green (that is what I had) paint along them and put them back.

  Over the course of teaching I have come to look for certain things with pencils. Pre-sharpened pencils are convenient because they are ready to use, and with younger students that takes out the play surrounded with needing to sharpen it. The eraser I would say is middle of the line, not horrible, but not the best I've ever used. It does leave a slight evidence on the paper of the erasure. I like the box that it arrived in and is a great box to store then when not in use. For the price, I feel like these are a great product and would purchase more if needed in the future.

  Call me retro but I've yet to find a device I feel as free to express ideas with as a pencil and paper. Whether notating music, drawing, marking wood for cutting, or just writing drafts I always keep plenty within reach at my desk and downstairs in the shop (along with my pocket knife and sharpeners of course).These are comparable in color and weight and crispness to countless others I've used. HBs are mid-scale on the hardness/softness scale and good general use pencils - if I'm drawing or marking darker surfaces I'll use something softer.I prefer to sharpen my own: the pre-cut on these has a shorter tip and sharper angle than I get with either my hand crank or electric sharpeners. The broader cut matches my hand grip better - and I'll use a pocket knife to make wide stub to mark wood with.Bottom Line: as utilitarian as they come - and that's fine by me.And yeah you can chew them - but keep those to yourself please!

  I have scoured the earth in search of the perfect pencil, and now that I have finally found it, I feel that my purpose in life has been fulfilled. My soul is at rest. These pencils arrived sharped to the perfect point, allowing for a level of precision that my eyes have never beheld. The color of the lead is the exact shade of graphite gray that other pencils have only dreamed of being, and have never achieved. When being held, this pencil fits the contours of my hand in a way that can only be described as a tender embrace by a loved one after many years apart. The salmon pink eraser inspires hope in the furthers reaches of my once cold, dead heart, and retracts mistakes in a most apologetic fashion. After one test-run with this pencil, in which I recreated my most recent tax return by hand, I knew that I had found a lifelong friend and confidant. I can finally stop paying for all of those therapy sessions! After endless years of disappointment in writing utensils that simply were not up for the task, my new transcribing partner and I can now begin my handwritten recreation of Marcel Proust's 9,609,000 character novel, ""A la recherche du temps perdu."" I can imagine no greater achievement in life, and I will owe it all to this box of pencils.

  I have to say, as a teacher, you get what you pay for with these. Stick with Ticonderoga!(and if you’re a parent, send your kiddos to school with Ticonderoga!) These pencils never stay sharpened or go without breaking a ridiculous number of times a day. I’m really surprised Amazon puts out a product like this. If you’re looking for a one time use, these are perfect. Otherwise you sharpen, lead literally falls out. Sharpen again, falls out again. By the end of our third grade day, there’s nothing left but a nub. I buy so much for my classroom, the least I ask is that they work! Very disappointing.

  I bought these pencils for my classroom and I have not been impressed. They sharpen to where they are very jagged looking, like where the wood is not smooth. Also, the students sharpen them and then the lead just falls out leaving them with a sharp wood tip 😑 My classtime is constantly being interrupted by the aggravating sound of the pencil sharpener and student coming up to me telling me that their pencil will not sharpen. I have always loved amazon basics and found their products to be of great quality. So I am not sure what happened with this one here. Maybe I got a bad batch? Who knows. But I will not be buying these again. Guess I’ll have to splurge for Ticonderoga pencils.

  I tutor kids out of my house, and I absolutely love these pencils when they are new.  I don't have time for kids to sharpen pencils during our quick time together, so being able to grab a fresh pencil quickly is the best!  They come pre-sharpened... that is so convenient.  The absolutey only issue I have with these pencils is how quickly they do get dull.  I find that I do go through a lot of pencils in one day.  I don't know if they're made differently or what, but they don't seem like they keep their sharpness as long as others.  With that being said, I still LOVE the sharpness they begin with, and I love that it is an entire cardboard box of presharpened pencils.

  With multiple kids homeschooling, I was tired of hearing the pencil sharpener nonstop all the time. (Do they REALLY need sharpened, or do you just want an break from your math, ha ha.)

  These are no Ticonderogas, but the graphite and erasers are good. They are also super inexpensive, which make them an excellent choice for teachers who have to have them onhand all the time only to see them walk out the door.They're a little lightweight/ bendy for my taste, and they don't smell like cedar. But they are good to have around.

  One does one say about #2 pencils. Holding one makes the school nightmares of standardized testing rush instantly back, but besides that not much to say. I love that these are presharpened which is just a nice bonus when ordering pencils. Grab one out and it's already ready to go. These Amazon Basics pencils are just as good as any name brand pencil but cost less. I've been a big fan of Amazon Basics products in the past as they have been great quality and lower in price, and these are no exception. I highly recommend these if you're looking for some #2 pencils. The eraser even works well.

  When I was a kid the house we bought even had one of those crank style pencil sharpeners that was in every school room.  You can still buy those crank style although they are cheaper made and don't do as good of job as they used too.  I'm actually surprised that they still sell them and for that matter pencils as well.  With electronic tablets, and there fancy ways of writing things down, the old pencil with an eraser seems very old fashioned, e would have expected it to go the way of mechanical pencils at least by now.  These are the same quality you used to get back in my school days.  HB is a very soft lead that takes little pressure to write or print darkly. When I worked in an engineering technician design group the drafting leads we used were 4H, 2H and HB most frequently, with HB the one for the darkest border lines.  It was difficult to use in a mechanical pencil as the thin leads broke frequently because of how soft they are.  So we used thicker versions in lead holders and sharpened with a special lead pointer or the old style way with a sand paper stick.These don't break quite as easy as the thin mechanicals because it's a thicker lead encased in the wood covering.  You don't want to erase a lot because the dark soft lead tends to smear, but if you have the right touch you can use these to draw, print, write without much problems.  One of the few pencils that you can sketch with and create different intensities of pencil shade.  4H and higher make that difficult because even if you press hard you don't get dark the leads are so hard.  Perfect for a business, or just to have a lot of writing instruments around the house, and since pencil sharpeners are not has handy as they once were in every kids pencil box, pre-sharpened is the way to do, you will need to sharpen with a sharpener if you use them frequently though.  I've sharpened pencils with a knife in the past, but with HB it's darn near impossible without breaking the lead.  Recommended for those who still use pencils for school, or just jotting down notes at home.

  These are great pencils and are perfect for my family of two elementary school children. They already come pre-sharpened, a huge bonus for me, and are gentle in the sharpener for further uses. It states their are 150 pencils in the box, which I will admit I did not count. The eraser is made to withstand heavy use and actually seemed to hold up better compared to their Ticonderoga pencils. I could not be more pleased and highly recommend to all students and classrooms.

  As a teacher, you can never have enough pencils. I was excited that these were presharpened. As any teacher knows, sometimes the little things will save you a lot of time. However, when they arrived I was a little disappointed at the sharpening. This sounds like a silly thing to say, but fellow teachers will understand. They are not sharp enough. If you hand a student a pencil that is sharpened to the bare minimum like this, they will ask to sharpen it. So, does it really save us any time? Debatable. I suppose you could then sharpen them on a per request basis. However, that may become a bit much. I decided to farther sharpen the ones that I took in to test before handing them out.The pencils are great pencils. I personally have never understood the brand preference when it comes to pencils. I have seen children destroy pencils of all qualities and they all write. I personally go for the cheaper the better. With that being said, these are quality pencils. They write well and the ones that I have handed out are holding up as well as any pencils. They do not break easily and they write well. The listing is currently unavailable, so I cannot see the price. However, I would recommend these pencils.

  These are decent writing pencils and a box of pre-sharpened pencils is wonderful to have around.  Just grab one and start writing.  No need to try to find the hand crank pencil sharpener or get up to walk to the office to use the electric sharpener.  Very convenient, especially when there are many hands that need a pencil. Plenty to go around.  And, thankfully, the eraser works good, too.

Also good for filling out other organizers, e.g. for tax forms, so I can erase errors;  then I photo copy the final version, so the copy of course is not eraseable.I still find the need for old fashioned pencils, and I like Amazon Presharpened Wood Cased #2 HB from Amazon Basics.

  Amazon Basic pencils are just as good, if not better than any other #2 pencils I have used.They are made of wood, with a solid graphite core.Often when you sharpen a pencil, the lead is wobbly and breaks easily. Not so with these, thus far. The lead stays firmly in place.The erasers on the pencils are good quality as well, and the leads are a true #2, dark and satisfying to write with.The set of 30 pencils comes perfectly presharpened, a significant timesaver when you or your child wants to get right to work.

The cost differential between unsharpened and presharpened tends to be minimal, and the benefits of having a perfectly sharpened pencil on the first day of school is huge, especially when kids are anxious. If you are a pencil user, then you will happy to know that the erasers on these pencils are also good - they are soft and erase well. (It is pretty aggravating to find a fun pencil only to discover the eraser has a film on it that actually prevents the user from erasing!)

  As the name would imply, this is a basic #2 lead pencil with an attached eraser.  It's nice that the 150 pencils come pre-sharpened to some degree because that makes them easier to put into a manual or electric sharpener when that little bit of lead is used up.  The pencil is six sided so it won't roll around on a table or desk.  The lead is a standard shade you expect from a #2 and the eraser does a good job of removing the lead when you need for it to.  The pencil has Amazon Basics #2 HB printed on it.  This is a good, basic #2 pencil.

  Oh my! I must praise these pencils!!! Most of us grow up hating pencils because they signified 12 years of assignments, homework, and standardized testing. As a matter of fact, for me, pencils were only good for pencil fights and love letters! Lol! However, I have grown to love the potential of these yellow #2 wood pencils! The points stay sharp, the wood handles are just the right size and are comfortable, and the erasers last a long time! And they have so many uses...drawing, writing, relaxing devices, scratching devices, and if we ever have a vampire or zombie apacolypse they would prove very useful! 😉 I highly recommend a box or two!

  Number One, these pencils changed my life. Number Two, they are absolutely worth the investment. Pencils are such a handy every day tool and man these ones truly hit the mark. Case in point, the pencils come pre-sharpened and that really shaves off a bunch of wasted time. No need to read between the lines for this item, you are going to get exactly what you paid for. These pencils are a dime a dozen and their usefulness can not be erased. You will not be disapPOINTed.

  These are pencils….what can I say. My daughter needs pencils for homework. These come in handy. We also need pencils for a medical log we keep for her in case we need to change something, and we use these. We have not had one break or not sharpen. They are made well.

  Nice price for big box of pencils. Good for teachers, libraries, artists, big families, and those of us who like to do the crossword in pencil (and balance the checkbook). They have the basic #2 lead, not too light, not too dark. They come pre-sharpened. The points are tiny and won't last long at first before you have to sharpen them again, but at least they didn't break during shipping. When you sharpen them, you can put a bigger point on them.

  So this is the world we've come to. Now my pencils say Amazon on them. My batteries say Amazon, I have cables that say Amazon, and of course I have tablets that say Amazon. A lot of these items are great. A few have just been ok. These pencils are great. I like that they come sharpened, but they sharpen well after that. The erasers are good. I've had junk cheap pencils before, and these are good inexpensive pencils. I like them and do suggest them!

  I've bought a few of these boxes in the past.  The last box I purchased did not last long in the classroom.  The lead tip would break off constantly and it made the whole box almost useless.  The first few boxes I had worked great.  The last box was a waste of money. I will try another box to see if it is any better than the last one I bought.

  To me, a pencil is a pencil is a pencil. That is, until there's something wrong. There's not a thing wrong with these standard #2 pencils. They come pre-sharpened to a blunt point, perform as expected, and have decent erasures. When it's necessary to sharpen again, they withstand the rigours of both handheld and electric, without splitting or chipping. Look to Amazon Basics when you want a good, solid number two. Recommended.

  Like the name suggests, these are basic wood pencils. The box in which they are displayed is not a wooden box container but a cardboard box. For this reason, you should open the box carefully since this container cardboard box is the best way to store the pencils. The pencils are good quality and sharpen without the graphite breaking. In the past, I have had problems with graphite or lead breakage when sharpening some pencils. I was glad to see that these basic pencils weren't of poor quality. Although they are already sharpened, you should obtain a pencil sharpener if you haven't already unless it is your plan to throw away a pencil that has become dull and then reach for a sharp one. I know I am stating the obvious but it is easy to overlook little details like that in a world where pencils are much less central to our lives.

  150 pencils is a lot of pencils... About 14 dozen, which makes this perfect for back to school shopping. A school year supply for a very modest price and you don't even need to sharpen them. This makes them perfect for the classroom, since you can just grab and go without needing to distract everyone with sharpening. Inside the box there's a foam sheet and a cardboard sheet on the sharpened side to keep the leads from breaking during shipping and it seems to work, since despite a very abstract sketch indicating a rough shipping... every pencil was intact. The erasers are good, not as nice as some high polymer erasers, but better than most cheap pencils. They erase cleanly without tearing, but someone who is error prone or is slightly heavy handed will burn through it way before the pencil is finished.

  These pencils are great replacements for the smaller packs I usually get. The lead is very standard, maybe a bit darker than some brands of #2 pencils I have tried. I'm an artist and I draw incessantly. My favorite pencil is the #2 for ease of restocking and cost. I can get a great line out of these while still being able to sock in a great shadow texture. I like the fact that these are on the darker side of the value range (warning: I am a pencil connoisseur–most people will not be able to tell the difference between the lighter brands).I also like the fact that the pencils are pre-sharpened. I dislike having to sharpen the entire pack with my mechanical sharpener the first thing. These pencils allow me to dive right in and sharpen as I go. Nice.

  This box of pres-sharpened #2 pencils is about as convenient as convenient can get.  While I don't mind sharpening pencils, sharpening them for the first time is more labor intensive than I'd like, since I'm kind of old fashioned and don't have an electric pencil sharpener.  The pencils appear to be of the highest quality and the price is right, too.  Definitely recommended.

  Not much to be said about simple, #2 hard pencils, except to say that they are perfectly adequate.  There is nothing bad about these pencils that would cause me to choose another batch of 30 over these AmazonBasics, except price.  So I suggest you do some comparison shopping to find your best deal. If these are comparably priced, I would not hesitate to get these.In fact, these are conveniently packaged in a plain kraft box that protects them from breakage.  They are pre-sharpened, which is a convenience.  The points are protected inside the box by a piece of Styrofoam.What is important to me, and what I immediately look for when choosing pencils:  The eraser works!  It is soft enough to do its job and not so hard that it leaves a mark on white paper.  That is a major plus in my book.  I will chose a pencil with a good eraser over a ""pretty"" pencil shaft any day!These pencils are full length.I have not found any with broken leads inside the shaft.

  Amazing! I am forever changed. Never again do I have to worry about running out of ink, or accidentally knocking it over. And that pink thing at the end? Absolutely magical. I can write something, and then make it disappear! Made a mistake? Not any more! The one issue I have is that after writing for a while the point gets too stubby, but these are so cheap for what they can do I have no problem buying more. Heaven bless the genius who developed these!!!

  Just what you'd expect: A box of nice standard pencils. Pre-sharpened to a good point. They write well, and all the leads are centered so re-sharpening them is easy too. If you are wondering - yes, I've had pencils where the lead wasn't in the exact center so when I sharpened them half my writing surface was wood. So, I appreciate the fact that the lead in these is centered in the wood.

  These are nice pencils, good quality. We use them in our homeschooling.  They come pre-sharpened, which saves me a ton of time because when it comes to sharpening pencils in our house, my children flee and leave that task to me. It's so convenient to just pop another pencil out of the box and worry about sharpening the dull ones at a more convenient time.

  These are great, solid pencils.  I was concerned that the inner core wouldn't be the hard, crisp wood and that these would be that soft, pliable kind, but these are good ole' standard #2 pencils.  The erasers are good quality and erase well.  I like that these arrive in the box resharpened, because really, who wants to sharpen 100+ pencils?  The tips are sharp, but short. I personally like the really long pointy sharp tips (that tend to snap when you press too hard), but these aren't like that, which is actually a good thing, making it less likely to snap or crumble with too much pressure.  This is a must-have item for any teacher.  I gave these as a gift to my daughter's 5th grade teacher.

  These are good pencils. The graphite provides a clean, smooth line- no grittiness at all. The wood is tight and doesn't come apart with successive sharpening. I find them great both for drawing and writing. When I draw, they smear and blend as they should for nice gradations and smooth grays.  The erasers are okay, if a bit harsh.

  I'm certainly not at risk of blowing a bunch of cash in a pencil shop, but, as a obsessive list-maker, I do enjoy a good pencil. My favorite is the dark, velvety but firm Mirado Black Warrior (a modest $2.49 locally for 8 pre-sharpened; or less, unsharpened).These pencils are just a standard #2, servicable but unremarkable, a decent pencil with a decent eraser. Hard enough to make a crisp line, soft enough to write easily. Not discouraging, but not as satisfying as my usual.I do think they write better freshly sharpened, but a whole box pre-sharpened is very handy, especially for groups.

  Ho preso queste matite come scorta per la scuola e per i miei disegni che faccio come hobby.Avevo letto delle recensioni contrastanti dove alcune dicevano che le matite si rompevano qusndo venivano temperate ed ero rimasta in dubbio. Però visto che mio figlio frequentera' la terza elementare ho voluto rischiare visto che non utilizzano più la matita come bene primario per scrivere.Ora che sono arrivate e le abbiamo provate e anche temperate posso dire che quanto mai non le ho scoperte prima! Avrei risparmiato un sacco di soldi calcolando la mole di matite che mio figlio ha utilizzato tra la prima e la seconda elementare.La matita ha un tratto ben marcato e non è per niente dura. Abbiamo privato a temperarla e non abbiamo avuto nessun problema. Ovvio che il temperino non deve avere la lama rovinata altrimenti qualsiasi matita si spacca.Davvero molto ma molto soddisfatta abbiamo matite per un bel po' di anni e ad un prezzo super vantaggioso.

  Amazon Basic products are usually pretty dependable, but these were the most frustrating pencils I've ever purchased - the leads snapped 80% of the time I'd go to sharpen them, essentially making them all unusable. I even bought a new sharpener to make sure that wasn't the issue. I'm going to stick to Staedtlers from now on - the leads never break and they're worth the slight increase in price for the lesser hassle.

  I bought these thinking I wouldn't need to buy pencils for a long time. These are horrible. They look great when you first open the box, but when you need to sharpen them you will sharpen and sharpen and sharpen and never be able to use it because 1) the lead will snap off in the sharpener almost every time or 2) the pencil will be too ""slivery"".

  I’m a teacher and due to budget cuts have resorted to buying my own pencils.  I bought these as I thought I could trust the amazon brand.  They are rubbish!  The lead on them keeps snapping so my students are spending more time sharpening their brand new pencils than they are writing.  I don’t know if I somehow got a bad batch, or if they were dropped on their way to me but I was really disappointed in this product.

  They are cheap and they write well enough but the wood & lead are of poor quality and do not sharpen evenly resulting in more broken leads than on a more expensive pencil.See picture of 2 amazon pencils vs a higher cost pencil sharpened with the same sharpener.

  Firstly - these pencils are good pencils. Presharpened is nice and means ease of use right away. Bought these for the kids as they return back to school. The problem is that the box shown in the photo doesn't really match the box they come in. It doesn't open easily and is pretty dang small to be honest. But in the end the final product is what matters right?

   Circa 2 anni fa ho comprato il pacco di matite amazonbasics non temperate da 96 pezzi. Le abbiamo finite quasi tutte e considerato il consumo di matite che abbiamo in casa tra scuole, cruciverba e papà che ne usa una nuova quasi ogni volta che fa un lavoro murato o con il legno, ho deciso di provare queste ""nuove"" matite di Amazon. La differenza principale è che sono già temperate, ed ho avuto l'impressione che questo ne allunghi la vita. Il legno sembra rimasto lo stesso, non una qualità altissima, non legno di cedro puro e profumato, ma un legno comunque con cui non ho mai avuto problemi in due anni. Tra le foto ne ho aggiunta una in cui è possibile confrontare i tratti di diverse anche di matite. Queste amazonbasics, come le vecchie non temperate, hanno un tratto abbastanza marcato. Anche la gommina è rimasta la stessa, di qualità discreta, fa bene il suo lavoro. Per 0,1011 €/pezzo ( al mio acquisto, 15,17€ la scatola da 150 ) è in assoluto la confezione di matite più economica che io abbia trovato su Amazon, e sono delle buone matite.Mi rattrista un po' che il colore di queste già pretemperate sia un po' più spento di quello che già avevo prima ma diciamocelo, nonostante anche l'occhio voglia la sua parte, il colore non è un elemento essenziale. In più non è che sia brutto, è solo un pochino più scuro.AGGIORNAMENTO 31 agosto 2020 (un altro anno accademico sta per iniziare...)E noi non abbiamo ancora finito il pacco da 150, per fortuna. Voglio aggiungere questo pezzo perché con un anno in più di utilizzo di queste matite, io non ne ho ancora trovata una rotta ed inutilizzabile. Volevo quindi stressare quanto io mi stia trovando bene con le matite Amazonbasics. Ho aggiunto una foto di uno schemino veloce che avevo fatto mentre studiavo, scritto con queste matite. Ho aggiunto anche un video in cui calcando un po’ faccio uno scarabocchio e poi cerco di far sbavare la matita. Si vede per bene che la matita le prime volte che ci passo, non sbava. Sbava solo passando il pollice con più forza. Poi ho cancellato il ghirigoro per mostrare il funzionamento della gomma; si vede che non è una cancellazione perfettissima, ma la ritengo decisamente sufficiente per chiunque non stia facendo il disegno del progetto di uno shuttle spaziale (anche negli appunti ci sono dele cancellature, sfido a trovarle!).

  Pessime davvero! Ok che mia figlia fa prima elementare, quindi si sa a quell'età devono ancora acquisire le competenze necessarie per un ordine e ''riguardo'' dei prodotti di cancelleria ma obiettivamente sono intemperabili... provate in 3 temperini differenti e il risultato... legno scheggiato, punta rotta in continuazione e siamo arrivate già a meno di metà della matita in due giorni solo di utilizzo... spendere un po' di più per un prodotto di vera qualità in questo caso ha davvero un senso.... adesso ne ho da smaltire 30!!!!!! Unico lato positivo.... la presenza della gomma al vertice della matita. Per il resto lasciate perdere!!!!

  Il set di matite in oggetto è composto da ben trenta pezzi (di egual forma e misura). Fatta questa breve, anzi brevissima premessa descrizione iniziale, non vi nascondo che, inizialmente, ero scettico all'acquisto di queste matite, poiché vengono prodotte da un marchio non leader in questo settore e, come tante altre marche di queste, finiscono per far cilecca. Scettico, ma allo stesso tempo curioso di testarle decido, pertanto, di finalizzare l'acquisto. Ad oggi la scelta che ho fatto si è rivelata vincente (smentendomi), perché le matite sono di ottima qualità e, per prendere appunti, non hanno nulla da invidiare alle marche più blasonate (vedi STAEDTLER). La ciliegina sulla torta è rappresentata dalla gommina (per cancellare), posta all'apice della matita. CONSIGLIO, vivamente, l'acquisto.SE HAI TROVATO UTILE LA MIA OPINIONE, FAMMELO SAPERE CON L'APPOSITO TASTO.

  150 matite, una scatola così grande, a soli 15 euro, il prezzo è davvero economico, ma rispetto ad altri prezzi sono moderati, però la qualità è abbastanza buona, la matita è anche molto facile da scrivere, non c'è situazione per iscritto  Apparve, il legno sulla matita non era rotto o marcio.  In breve, questo prezzo, questa qualità, vanno bene.

  Die Mine ist extrem empfindlich. Spätestens nachdem der Stift einmal runtergefallen ist, kann man ihn direkt wegschmeißen. Auch ohne runterfallen bricht die Mine oft beim nachspitzen. Kauft euch lieber 5 Stifte eines Markenherstellers, die halten länger als 20 von denen hier. Wenn ein Stift dann mal in einem schreibfähigen Zustand ist, ist er eigentlich ganz gut.

  ho finalmente coronato il sogno di una vita, 150 matite al prezzo di 10 centesimi l'una che mi permetteranno di non dover MAI PIU' comprare assolutamente nessuna matita... apparte gli scherzi è un buon prodotto chiaramente non sono matite eccezionali ma a questo prezzo sono davvero ottime, mi sento di consigliarle assolutamente anche perché essendo un prodotto amazonbasics c'è sempre una certa garanzia sia in termini di affidabilità di cosa si sta comprando che in termini di spedizione.

  Come si fa a dire di no a ben trenta matite ad un prezzo così basso?In ufficio ce n'è sempre bisogno, perciò non potevo farmi sfuggire una occasione come questa per delle matite che, tutto sommato, sono anche molto buone per chi le usa senza troppe pretese.E' materiale di cancelleria ovviamente, artisti ed architetti dovrebbero volgere le proprie ricerche altrove per avere dei prodotti di tipo più specialistico. Tuttavia posso dire che io le trovo molto comode così come i miei colleghi ai quali ne ho subito regalata qualcuna, e poi sono proprio quelle con la gommina sull'altra estremità che le rende oltremodo utili quando hai bisogno di cancellare qualcosa e non ha la gomma a portata di mano.

  The quality is good.  Write nicely and easily re-sharpened.  I think the packing should have more paddings to prevent shatter leads during shipping.  I guess the 4 to 5 stars reviews are the lucky shipping and the 3 below stars are not so lucky.  I strongly believe the pencils are very good itself from the factory.

  Da meine Tochter immer ihre Stifte verschlampt oder verliert oder geklaut werden hatte ich mir diesmal gesagt eine große 150 Stiftebox zu kaufen und komme damit dann über das ganze Schulalter. Die Stifte funktionieren einwandfrei. Die farbe wird sehr leicht aufgetragen beim aufsetzen des stiftes wie jeder andere stimmt was soll man noch dazu sagen. Ich finde es einfach nur klasse dass es 150 stifte sind. Von meiner seite auch hier klare kaufempfehlung.

  Me han gustado, escriben bien, de forma suave, sin rascar la hoja.Cada uno viene con su goma.No dan problemas al sacarles punta.El precio es buenísimo, sale a 11 céntimos cada lápiz (caja de 150 unidades).Con la cantidad de lápices que gastamos en casa para mi es una buenísima compra.

  Muy buena relación  calidad-precio, sobre todo la cantidad de lápices.  Al igual  que todos  los productos  amazon basics, no decepciona. Ideal para oficinas, colegios y universidades. Los lápices no pueden faltar.

  Die Minen sind absolut schlechte Qualität. Beim Anspitzen ging mehrmals die Hälfte des ganzen Bleistift verloren, weil die Mine ständig abbrach.

  None came broken and they seemed to work a lot better than basic staples school pencils and dollarama pencils.

  Je croyais que la boîte me durerait longtemps, mais je ne peux presque pas les utiliser... décevant.
